Portfolio website created using HTML, CSS and Javascript
This project is related to my case study of a work-flow based on a testing lab. I have created a landing page and two forms – Login & Registration.
1. Login Form allows users to login with Username and password. Also, there is a drop-down menu which has three options – Admin, Patient & Provider. A JavaScript validation to validate the username and password is included in the myscripts.js file. Attached files areLogin.html, style.css & myscripts.js
2. Registration Formallows users to create an account with Firstname, Lastname, Phone number, username and password. A Regex validation to check if the phone number is included in the myscript.js file. Attached files areRegister.html, style.css & myscripts.js
3. Website- This is the landing page for a labMedlabs . Created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Flexbox.
